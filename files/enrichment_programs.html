      <h1>Educational Enrichment Programs</h1>
      <h2>
        In addition to their classroom teachers, all children enrolled in the
        Washington University Nursery School interact regularly with
        specialists in art, music, Spanish and science.

      <h3>Spanish with Miss Colleen</h3>
      <p>¡Hola! (Hello!) de Señora Colleen (from Miss Colleen)</p>
      <p>
        I am excited to begin my seventh year teaching the Spanish enrichment
        program at WUNS. My philosophy in teaching Spanish is to keep it fun,
        simple and multi-sensory. Whether through song, props, games or
        movement, I like to introduce vocabulary and simple phrases in
        memorable ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a week I will be visiting each classroom for 15 – 20 minutes for
        songs, games and stories in Spanish. On this website, I will list the
        vocabulary we are learning, the lyrics to a song, and/or an overview
        of lessons. Repetition is key to learning, so I will circle back to
        certain lessons throughout the year for review and recall.

      <h3>Art with Miss Suzy</h3>
      <p>
        <a class="download" href="downloads/WUNS-announcement-ART.pdf" target="_blank">Letter from Ms. Suzy about WUNS
          Art Enrichment for School Year
          </a><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
        Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
        each month and build understanding through conversations and
        experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
        home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
        of Art.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at WUNS
        since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion for
        the Visual Arts with the children! Each and every year I am reminded
        and continually astounded at the beauty, simplicity and sincerity of
        each young Artist’s understandings and renderings of Art from their
        personal perspective. Thank you for sharing your Preschooler with me!
      </p>
      <h3>Music with Ms. Christina</h3>
      <p>
        I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
        year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
        taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
        teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed a
        variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but I
        have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
        music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
        make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to share
        that joy with all the bears at WUNS…including my own little boy who is
        a Big Bear and Sun Bear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
        songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
        children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
        classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our
        voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion
        instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we
        create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore
        tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be
        fun!

      <h3>Nature on the Move with Miss Becky</h3>
      <p>
        I am thrilled to be continuing the Nature on the Move program that has
        been coming to WUNS for 18 years. I believe that one way to preserve
        our natural resources is to teach the youngest members of our society
        to love and respect the natural world around them. Nature on the Move
        allows children to get up close to Missouri’s wildlife and learn how
        each living thing affects the world in which they live. I will visit
        WUNS once per month with a lively presentation on a variety of topics.

              <p>
                Colleen Corbett begins her seventh year as a teacher at WUNS,
                teaming for the sixth year with Katie in the Sun Bear classroom. She
                also is the Spanish specialist, teaching once weekly lessons to all
                the classrooms. In addition, Colleen coordinates the morning Bear
                Tracks program and maintains the WUNS website. She worked in the
                student technology and training department for five years at
                Washington University prior to transferring to the nursery school in
                2013.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before coming to Washington University, she taught second grade for
                nine years at The College School. Her degrees include a Bachelor of
                Arts in English, with minors in Spanish, writing, and women’s
                studies, and a Master of Education, both attained from the
                University of Missouri. Additional graduate school hours in early
                childhood education and writing were attained at Webster University
                and Washington University in St. Louis. Her favorite activity with
                the children is sharing literature that connects to experiences in
                the classroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Colleen loves to travel and play in the outdoors with her wonderful,
                over-functioning but humble husband. They live in Webster Groves
                with their fur-daughter, a mutt named Sadie who thinks she’s a
                princess. Their biological daughter is finally launched–she is a
                resident physician at Cincinnati’s Children’s Hospital.

                She joined the WUNS staff in 2001. Her undergraduate degree is in
                art education (K – 12) from Missouri State University. She also
                attained a Master of Arts in early childhood education from Webster

                Suzy teaches in the Big Bear classroom and is the art specialist at
                WUNS, bringing her passion for teaching art through literature and
                hands-on experiences to the children. She also coordinates the
                afternoon Bear Tracks program. Suzy believes that WUNS is a special
                place to teach because of the diversity of the families and the
                school’s commitment to the developmental needs of the students.

                with her family, taking walks, enjoying nature, making art,
                practicing yoga, and watching Sydney play soccer.
