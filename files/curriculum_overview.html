          <h4>Spanish with Miss Colleen</h4>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <br>
          <p>¡Hola! (Hello!) de Señora Colleen (from Miss Colleen)</p>
          <p>
            I am excited to begin my seventh year teaching the Spanish enrichment
            program at WUNS. My philosophy in teaching Spanish is to keep it fun,
            simple and multi-sensory. Whether through song, props, games or
            movement, I like to introduce vocabulary and simple phrases in
            memorable ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a week I will be visiting each classroom for 15 – 20 minutes for
            songs, games and stories in Spanish. On this website, I will list the
            vocabulary we are learning, the lyrics to a song, and/or an overview
            of lessons. Repetition is key to learning, so I will circle back to
            certain lessons throughout the year for review and recall.

                    Colleen Corbett begins her seventh year as a teacher at WUNS,
                    teaming for the sixth year with Katie in the Sun Bear classroom. She
                    also is the Spanish specialist, teaching once weekly lessons to all
                    the classrooms. In addition, Colleen coordinates the morning Bear
                    Tracks program and maintains the WUNS website. She worked in the
                    student technology and training department for five years at
                    Washington University prior to transferring to the nursery school in
                    2013.

                  <p>
                    Before coming to Washington University, she taught second grade for
                    nine years at The College School. Her degrees include a Bachelor of
                    Arts in English, with minors in Spanish, writing, and women’s
                    studies, and a Master of Education, both attained from the
                    University of Missouri. Additional graduate school hours in early
                    childhood education and writing were attained at Webster University
                    and Washington University in St. Louis. Her favorite activity with
                    the children is sharing literature that connects to experiences in
                    the classroom.

                    Colleen loves to travel and play in the outdoors with her wonderful,
                    over-functioning but humble husband. They live in Webster Groves
                    with their fur-daughter, a mutt named Sadie who thinks she’s a
                    princess. Their biological daughter is finally launched–she is a

          <p>
            I am thrilled to be continuing the Nature on the Move program that has
            been coming to WUNS for 18 years. I believe that one way to preserve
            our natural resources is to teach the youngest members of our society
            to love and respect the natural world around them. Nature on the Move
            allows children to get up close to Missouri’s wildlife and learn how
            each living thing affects the world in which they live. I will visit
            WUNS once per month with a lively presentation on a variety of topics.

                    Science in Early Childhood Education from the University of
                    Missouri-Columbia. She has taught young children for a total of 18
                    years, 6 in kindergarten and more recently 12 in Pre-K. Becky and
                    her husband Randy have been married for 26 years and have four
                    children, all currently in college. Becky and Randy love to spend
                    time on their property in Northeastern Missouri near Mark Twain Lake
                    where they enjoy watching and listening to all the wildlife,
                    fishing, boating, and riding their horses. Becky believes that one

            Each of the classes will have the opportunity to engage in Art
            Enrichment one time per month. We will introduce an Element of Art
            each month and build understanding through conversations and
            experiences in the Art Studio, that may be displayed and later sent
            home with a description of your child’s introduction to that Element
            of Art.

          <p>
            I have had the privilege and honor of teaching Art Enrichment at WUNS
            since 2002. It is a great joy to share my knowledge and passion for
            the Visual Arts with the children! Each and every year I am reminded
            and continually astounded at the beauty, simplicity and sincerity of
            each young Artist’s understandings and renderings of Art from their
            personal perspective. Thank you for sharing your Preschooler with me!

                    art education (K – 12) from Missouri State University. She also

                    place to teach because of the diversity of the families and the

            I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
            year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
            taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
            teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed a
            variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but I
            have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
            music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
            make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to share
            that joy with all the bears at WUNS…including my own little boy who is
            a Big Bear and Sun Bear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
            songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
            children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
            classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our
            voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion
            instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we
            create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore
            tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be
            fun!

      <p>Students at Washington University Nursery School enjoy exploring visual arts, music and drama
        with specialists in these areas, in addition to the artistic opportunities that abound as part of their
        everyday curriculum in the classroom and on the playground. The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on
        an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
        meet students’ needs. <br><br> If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
        of ways, which may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
          process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
        <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
        <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
        <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
        <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
          order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
        <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
          concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
        students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
        group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
        informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
        and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
        Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
        curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
        child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
        read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
